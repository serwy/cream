<p>
The CREAM technique can be used for both retrospective and prospective analysis. Here is how to use it.

<p>

1) Identify the Common Performance Conditions, under 'CPC'<br>
2) Start with a genotype "Error Mode" (with retrospective) or a phenotype "MTO triad" (with prospective) under 'Workspace'<br>
3) For each step, select a Specfic Consequent to better explain the step. <br>
4) For retrospective analysis, if there is enough information to select a specific antecedent, then do so. The analysis stops for that branch. <br>
5) Continue with each step of the analysis, exploring all the likely paths as shown in the left panel of the Workspace.
